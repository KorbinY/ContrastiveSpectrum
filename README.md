# ContrastiveSpectrum

This project aims to find an effective way to implement contrastive learning from the spectral perspective.

Potential topics may include: the corrsponding changes in spatial and spectral domains, if augmentation is necessary; (if yes) augmentation methods and their advantages; contrastive learning on spectrum; mathematical or theoratical proof for spectral contrastive learning; complexity and overhead, etc.
