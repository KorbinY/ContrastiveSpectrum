This project aims to find an effective way to implement contrastive learning on graph data from the spectral perspective.

Potential topics may include: the corresponding changes in spatial and spectral domains, if augmentation is necessary; (if yes) augmentation methods and their advantages; contrastive learning on the spectrum; mathematical or theoretical proof for spectral contrastive learning; complexity and overhead, etc.
